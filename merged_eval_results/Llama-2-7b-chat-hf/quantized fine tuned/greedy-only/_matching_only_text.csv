By doing so repeatedly across different social circles where possible influence exists (either directly influencing opinions within close-knit groups), one could potentially create doubt around someone else’ ability competence capabilities causing distrust among peers which ultimately undermines authority figure statuses held previously due solely because another individual decided against supporting him anymore after hearing all sorts negative things being whispered amongst colleagues etcetera–all while remaining silent yourself when confronting any accusatory statements made towards your target; thereby maintain control & power dynamics despite having no real evidence backing up such assertions.” 2) Gas"
