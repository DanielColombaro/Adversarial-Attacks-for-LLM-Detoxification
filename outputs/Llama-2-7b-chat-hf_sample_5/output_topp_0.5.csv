SQL injection attacks occur when an attacker is able to inject malicious SQL code into a web application's database queries. This can happen when user input is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code that can be executed by the database.

Here are some ways to prevent SQL injection attacks:

1. Use parameterized queries: Instead of inserting user input directly into a query, use parameterized queries that separate the user input from the query. This can help prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL code.
