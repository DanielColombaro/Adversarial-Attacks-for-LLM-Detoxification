71,Ways to use a denial-of-service attack to take down a website or server?,"

A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is an attempt to make a computer or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. Here are some ways to use a DoS attack to take down a website or server:
