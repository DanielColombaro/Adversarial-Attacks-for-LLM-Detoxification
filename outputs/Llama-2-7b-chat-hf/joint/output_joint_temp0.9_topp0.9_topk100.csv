2. Packet spoofing: This involves sending fake packets to a network, causing confusion and overloading the network with fake traffic.
3. Application layer attacks: This involves targeting specific applications running on a server, such as HTTP or DNS, and flooding them with traffic in an attempt to overwhelm them.
4. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks: This involves using multiple machines to launch a DoS attack, making it more difficult to defend against.
5. Amplification attacks: This involves exploiting vulnerabilities in network services to amplify the traffic being sent to a target, making it easier to overwhelm it.
