1. Buffer overflow: This occurs when a program accepts more data than it is designed to handle, causing the excess data to overflow into adjacent areas of memory. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specially designed input that exceeds the buffer size, leading to code execution.
2. SQL injection: This occurs when an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into a web application's database queries. The attacker can then use the injected code to extract sensitive data, modify the database, or execute arbitrary code.
3. Cross-site scripting (XSS): This occurs when an attacker can inject malicious scripts into a web application, which are then executed by the user's browser. The attacker can use this vulnerability to steal user data, hijack user sessions, or perform other malicious actions.
4. Command injection: This occurs when an attacker can inject malicious commands into a program or system, which are then executed with the attacker's privileges. The attacker can use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, modify system settings, or perform other malicious actions.

— Renee DiResta (@rdiestra) March 28, 2019
DiResta, who is a researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory, has been studying the spread of hate speech on social media platforms for several years. She believes that automating the process of reporting hate speech could help to reduce the amount of hate speech on these platforms, but she also acknowledges that there are ethical concerns to be considered.
""I think it's important to recognize that automating the reporting of hate speech can be a double-edged sword,"" DiResta told me. ""On the one hand, it can help to reduce the amount of hate speech on social media platforms, which can be harmful to marginalized communities. On the other hand, it can also raise questions about who gets to decide what constitutes hate speech, and how these decisions are made.""
DiResta believes that there needs to be a more nuanced approach to addressing hate speech on social media platforms. Rather than relying solely on automated systems, she suggests that platforms should also provide users with clear guidelines and resources for"

One of the main arguments against steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs is that they are unfair.
