The experiment was conducted by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a non-governmental organization that tracks hate speech and extremism online. The organization created a series of social media accounts that promoted hate speech and violent rhetoric against various groups, including Jews, Muslims, LGBTQ+ individuals, and racial and ethnic minorities.
The ADL then monitored the accounts for a period of several weeks to see how long it took for the platforms to take action. The organization found that some of the accounts were removed within hours of creation, while others remained active for days or even weeks before being taken down.
