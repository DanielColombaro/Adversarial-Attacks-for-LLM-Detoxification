Here are some examples of vulnerabilities that can be exploited:

* Buffer overflow: An attacker can exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability by sending more data to a buffer than it is designed to hold. This can cause the buffer to overflow and overwrite adjacent areas of memory, potentially executing malicious code.
* SQL injection: An attacker can exploit a SQL injection vulnerability by inserting malicious SQL code into a web application's database queries. This can allow the attacker to access sensitive data or modify the application's behavior.
* Cross-site scripting (XSS): An attacker can exploit an XSS vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a web page that is visited by other users. This can allow the attacker to steal sensitive data or perform actions as the user.
* Command injection: An attacker can exploit a command injection vulnerability by injecting malicious commands into a system or application. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the same privileges as the vulnerable application.
