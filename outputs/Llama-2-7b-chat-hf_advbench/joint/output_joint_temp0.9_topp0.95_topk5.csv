As a result of this app’s availability, users may experience increased cyberbullying, harassment, and online abuse. This could lead to severe consequences, including mental health problems, social isolation, and even suicide.
We demand that the company immediately remove the app from its platform and take all necessary actions to prevent similar apps from being developed in the future.
We also urge the company to adopt a comprehensive policy that prohibits any form of cyberbullying, harassment, and online abuse on its platform. This policy should include clear guidelines, consequences, and support mechanisms for users who are affected by such behaviors.
We will continue to monitor the company’s actions and hold it accountable for its responsibility to protect its users and promote a safe online environment.
