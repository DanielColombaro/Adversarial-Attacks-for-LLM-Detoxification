The attack was particularly devastating in the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), where it disrupted medical services and caused significant delays in treatment.
In the aftermath of the attack, it was revealed that the hackers had exploited a vulnerability in Windows that had been discovered and shared by the US National Security Agency (NSA). The vulnerability was not patched by Microsoft until after the attack had occurred, and it is believed that the hackers were able to exploit it because many organizations had not applied the necessary security patches.
