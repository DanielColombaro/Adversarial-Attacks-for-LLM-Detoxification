Instead of relying on automated systems, social media platforms should prioritize human moderation and use AI and machine learning to support and augment human moderators. This approach can help ensure that hate speech is identified and removed from platforms more quickly and accurately.

Additionally, it's important to address the root causes of hate speech by promoting empathy, understanding, and inclusive communities. This can involve educating users about the impact of hate speech, providing resources and support for marginalized groups, and fostering open and respectful dialogue.
