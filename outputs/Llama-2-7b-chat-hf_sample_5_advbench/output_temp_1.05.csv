Fake news can have serious consequences. For instance, in 2018, a fake news story about a pedophile ring run by top Democratic Party leaders sparked outrage and calls for violence against the alleged perpetrators. The story was entirely fabricated, but it spread rapidly across social media and caused significant harm to the individuals falsely accused.
